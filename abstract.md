Look at ME! - Intel ME Investigation

With Intel's Firmware Support Package (FSP) and the recent release of a
[redistributable firmware binary](https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/50920)
for the Management Engine, it has become possible to share full firmware images
for modern x86 platforms and potentially audit the binaries. Yet, reverse
engineering, decompilation and disassembly are still not permitted. However,
thanks to previous research, we can have a closer look at the binary data and
come to a few conclusions. This talk briefly summarizes the fundamentals of
developing custom and open source firmware, followed by a quick guide through
the process of analyzing the binaries without actually violating the terms to
understand a few bits, and finally poses a statement on the political issues
that researchers, repair technicians and software developers are facing
nowadays, taking into account how consumers are affected and how they perceive
the situtation eventually.
